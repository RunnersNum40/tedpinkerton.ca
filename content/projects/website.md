# Purpose
Creating a personal website allowed me to step away from proprietary platforms, have a dedicated space to document my work, and follow in the footsteps of individuals I admire.

# Build Process
## Static Site Generation
Utilizing [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator, I transformed collections of documents into a themed, static page, ensuring swift delivery and easy hosting.

I've employed the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/) theme with slight alterations to fit my preferences.

## Hosting on Netlify
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) hosts this site and facilitates automatic rebuilds and updates via a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/RunnersNum40/tedpinkerton.ca) whenever changes are pushed.

## Future Endeavors
I aim to introduce more reactive content and design a unique theme to better represent my personal brand.
