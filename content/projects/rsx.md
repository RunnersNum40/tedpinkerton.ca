# [Robotics for Space Exploration](https://rsx.skule.ca)

RSX is a mars rover design team. We build rovers and compete in various design competitions. The team is made up of sup-teams responsible for specific design tasks. In addition to competitions, we host events to promote space exploration to high school and undergraduate students. The sub-teams include:

- Mechanical, responsible for most physical components of the rover.
- Arm, responsible for an articulated robot arm mounted on the rover.
- Software, responsible for the rover control systems.
- Electrical, responsible for power storage and distribution and safety.
- Science, responsible for simulated space-based experiments.

## Competion

The main competitions we aim to attend are the [Univeristy Rover Challenge](https://urc.marssociety.org/), the [Canadian Rover Challenge](https://circ.cstag.ca/), and the [European Rover Challenge](https://roverchallenge.eu/en/main-page/). The specific competitions we attend each year depend on qualifying, the team's finances, and the team members' schedule.

## Mechanical Team

I lead the mechanical team. This year it's roughly twenty U of T students in engineering and science programs.

### Chassis

The chassis is responsible for mounting all other parts of the rover. It must be strong and stiff to maintain reliability while being light as the largest component of the rover.

This year's design is an aluminum extrusion with acrylic panels. Both of these are lightweight and provide easy mounting. The ease of mounting makes it easy for other sub-teams to prototype and speeds up development.

### Suspension

The suspension system keeps the rover stable over rugged terrain. We need to deal with hilly, rocky, and desert terrain.

This year's design is a buggy-style wishbone suspension. This is a change from the previous year's rocker-bogie, which should fix issues with the differential and hinges. The wishbones are being prototyped in custom carbon fibre, and the hinges are made of custom-bent aluminum sheet metal.

### Wheels

The wheels are the rover's contact with the ground, which requires durability and traction in sandy or grassy terrain.

This year's design is an airless tire 3D printed in TPU. We use a customized large format 3D printer to print wheels to prototype. The internal structure is designed to allow compliance, increasing the contact surface area. The tread angle is normal to the center of turning of the rover to decrease drag when turning in place.
