# [Robotics for Space Exploration (RSX)](https://rsx.skule.ca)

RSX is a Mars rover design team that competes in various design competitions. Beyond competitions, we host events promoting space exploration to students. The team comprises sub-teams, each focused on distinct design tasks:

- Mechanical: Handles the physical components of the rover.
- Arm: Manages an articulated robot arm mounted on the rover.
- Software: Oversees the rover control systems and autonomy.
- Electrical: Manages power storage, distribution, and safety.
- Science: Executes simulated space-based experiments.

## Competitions

We aim to participate in the [University Rover Challenge](https://urc.marssociety.org/), the [Canadian Rover Challenge](https://circ.cstag.ca/), and the [European Rover Challenge](https://roverchallenge.eu/en/main-page/), depending on qualifications, finances, and team availability.

## Mechanical Team

As the former Mechanical Lead, I had the privilege to guide a team of around twenty U of T students from various engineering and science programs. During my tenure, I expanded the team from three to twenty members, fostering a conducive learning environment and mentoring promising individuals who showed a keen interest in mechanical design.

### Chassis

The chassis serves as the backbone of the rover, housing all other components. The design focus was on achieving a balance between strength, stiffness, and weight. The utilization of aluminum extrusion with acrylic panels proved effective, facilitating easy mounting and accelerating the prototyping phase for other sub-teams.

### Suspension

I spearheaded the transition to a buggy-style wishbone suspension system, designing and creating custom carbon fiber forks, which I modeled and laid up myself. This design overhaul enhanced the rover's stability across rugged terrains, addressing the previous challenges faced with the differential and hinges in the rocker-bogie design.

### Wheels

The wheels were redesigned with an airless tire 3D printed in TPU to ensure durability and traction across varying terrains. Customization of a large format 3D printer enabled rapid prototyping, while the internal structure and tread angle adjustments improved surface contact and reduced drag during turns.

### Legacy

Under my direction, the rover evolved to be faster, stronger, more durable, more stable, and easier to maintain. The experience nurtured a culture of innovation, collaborative learning, and laid a solid foundation for the team's future endeavors in rover design and competitions.

## Software Team Transition

Having laid a strong mechanical foundation, I transitioned to the software team as a general member. I now contribute to the development of control systems and simulation for the rover, integrating my mechanical expertise to improve the software solutions that drive our rover's operations.
