Currently on a Professional Experience Year (PEY) at BioConnect as a front-end Intern, I am diving deeper into software development while applying my machine intelligence knowledge. My journey through robotics, both personally and as the Mechanical Lead of RSX at U of T, has fueled my passion for the elegant integration of hardware and software.

Feel free to explore my [skills page](/skills/) to learn about my technical expertise, and my [projects page](/projects/) to see my hands-on experience in action.
