### Engineering Design
While I have experience with many technical fields my greatest strength is adaptability and a broad knowlegebase to apply to problems. I am capable of working well in teams or leading teams, I have a strong analytical interest and practice in math topics, and I am familiar with an interative design process. These make me well suited to technical roles and teamwork senarios.

### Software Development

#### Python
I have six years of experience in Python developing personal projects and school work. 
I am familiar with data visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn, mathematical tools like Numpy and Scikit, machine learning tools like Tensorflow, Jax and Keras, and Pandas for data managment.

Along with familarity with important libraries I am competent in Pythonic code style and documentation.

#### C
Through many C projects and classes I am familar with C syntax and paradigms. 
I am comfortable using pointer arithmetic and all basic data structures.
C is not my strongest language but I am well positioned to quickly improve for any projects that require it.

In addition to C I have marginal experince in C++ and its Arduino variant.

<!-- #### Haskell
I have only dipped my toe into the world of functional programming and I have some knowlege of the monad paradigm. -->

<!-- #### C++
 -->

#### Regex
I am can use Regex to solve problems that require complex pattern based string parsing.
I particularly enjoy using [this tool](https://regexr.com/) to develop expressions.

#### Web-Development

### Mechanical Design
#### Fusion 360
I have many years of Fusion 360 experience both in hands-on work and leading teams with the team interface. I am very competent with parametric design, component hierarchies, joints, and complex multi-component designs. I can use the solid, surface, and sheet metal workspaces and the mesh space to modify mesh models.

#### Solidworks


#### Blender


#### Cura


#### Meshmixer


---
### Software Tools
#### Git


#### Verilog

#### Kanban

#### SVN

#### LTSpice

#### Microsoft Office

#### Linux, OSX, and Windows


---
### Hardware
#### Soldering
For electronic projects I can hand-solder through-hole and surface-mount chips on PCBs as well as strip and crimp wires.

<!-- ### FPGA Design-->

#### 3D-Printing
I personally own and operate three 3D-Printers. The two most interesting are my personalized Ender-5 Pro and my Anycubic Photon. I have extensive practice designing components for 3D-Printing to: avoid overhangs, avoid directional weakness, and improve print speeds. In addition I am familiar with slicing tools like Cura and Meshmixer, interface tools like Octoprint and Fulidd, and different firmwares like Marlin and Klipper.

#### Arduino
I've worked with Arduinos in nemrous projects and developed associated skills. I can develop in the Arduiono IDE and web-IDE using the Arduino language and it's libraries, wire Arduino boards, and flash ATmega chips.
