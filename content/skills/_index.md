### Engineering Design
My greatest strength is adaptability, the ability to learn quickly and a broad knowledge base to apply to problems. I can work well in teams or leading teams, have a strong analytical interest and practice in math topics, and am familiar with an iterative design process. These make me well-suited to technical roles and teamwork scenarios.

### Software Development

#### Python
I have six years of experience in Python developing personal projects and school work. I am familiar with data visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn, mathematical tools like Numpy and Scikit, machine learning tools like Tensorflow, Jax and Keras, and Pandas for data management.

I am also familiar with important libraries and am competent in Pythonic code style and documentation.

#### C
C is not my most robust language, but I am well-positioned to improve quickly for any projects that require it. I am familiar with C syntax and paradigms through many C projects and classes. I am comfortable using pointer arithmetic and all basic data structures.

In addition to C, I have marginal experience in C++ and its Arduino variant.

<!-- #### Haskell
I have only dipped my toe into the world of functional programming and I have some knowlege of the monad paradigm. -->

<!-- #### C++
 -->

#### Regex
I can use Regex to solve problems that require complex pattern-based string parsing.
I particularly enjoy using [this tool](https://regexr.com/) to develop expressions.

#### Web-Development
I can use high or low-level tools to create or support websites. I am familiar with DNS, DDNS, ports and site registration. I can make basic sites with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I can use static-site generators or wordpress to create more complex sites inclusing this one.

### Mechanical Design
#### Fusion 360
I have many years of Fusion 360 experience in hands-on work and leading teams with the team interface. I am competent with parametric design, component hierarchies, joints, and complex multi-component designs. I can use the solid, surface, and sheet metal workspaces and the mesh space to modify mesh models.

#### Solidworks


#### Blender


#### Cura
I can use Cura or other slicers to achieve optimal prints on various 3D printers.

#### Meshmixer


---
### Software Tools
#### Git
I have experience using git in the command line and GitHub desktop. I can collaborate effectively with others or use git as a personal version control tool.

#### Verilog


#### Kanban


#### SVN


#### LTSpice


#### Microsoft Office


#### Linux, OSX, and Windows
I can work competently in and install various operating systems on different systems. I’m comfortable using command-line tools to complete work and using SSH or VNC.

### Hardware
#### Soldering
I can hand-solder through-hole and surface-mount chips on PCBs and strip and crimp wires for electronic projects.

<!-- ### FPGA Design-->

#### 3D-Printing
I extensively practice designing components for 3D-Printing to avoid overhangs, directional weakness, and improve print speeds. I own and operate three 3D-Printers. The two most interesting are my personalized Ender-5 Pro and my Anycubic Photon. In addition, I am familiar with slicing tools like Cura and Meshmixer, interface tools like Octoprint and Fulidd, and different firmware like Marlin and Klipper.

#### Arduino
I’ve worked with Arduinos on numerous projects and developed associated skills. I can develop in the local and web Arduino IDE using the Arduino language and its libraries, wire Arduino boards, and flash ATmega chips.
