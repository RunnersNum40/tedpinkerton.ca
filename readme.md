Welcome to the repository of my personal website, built with Hugo and hosted on Netlify. I've made slight modifications to the [PaperMod](https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/) theme to suit my preferences.

## Overview
The primary purpose of this site is to serve as a portfolio showcasing my projects, experiences, and journey in the realm of engineering and machine intelligence.

## Structure
- `content/`: Where all the markdown files for the posts reside.
- `static/`: Contains static files such as images.
- `assets/`: Contains custom styling and scripts.
- `config.toml`: Configuration file for Hugo.

## Development
